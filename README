High level approach:

1. Scripts 
    - deploy dns and http to the nodes using scp and update permissions
    - runCDN 
        - runs the dnsserver with the port and dns name given
        - runs the httpserver on each replica node
    - stopCDN - stops dnsserver and all httpservers

2. httpserver - uses a socket to listen for queries from client and return a html
    - Queries the origin server if the query is not cached (requests.get())
    - LFU cache will be implemented to store most frequently queried hits
    
3. dnsserver - sets up geo database and uses a socket to listen to incoming requests
    - listens for DNS queries from clients
    - Currently returns only httpserver available (node A)
    - Will respond with closest replica server based on geolocation distance calculations
    - Implementation to follow with more http replica nodes

ISSUES:
- Port address in use sometimes - hard to test as the socket creation fails

WHO DID WHAT:
Utkarshna - deploy/run/stop scripts, httpserver
Ramzi - dnsserver, geo_db
