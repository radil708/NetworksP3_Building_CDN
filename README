High level approach:

1. Scripts 
    - deploy dns and http to the nodes using scp and update permissions
    - runCDN 
        - runs the dnsserver with the port and dns name given
        - runs the httpserver on each replica node
    - stopCDN - stops dnsserver and all httpservers
    ***Custom flags have been added for testing purposes (-d , -f)

2. httpserver - uses a socket to listen for queries from client and return a html
    - Queries the origin server if the query is not cached (requests.get())
    - LFU cache is used to remove the least frequently requested query file from the cache
    - Listens to dns requests to ping the client and return a rtt to the dnsserver
    
3. dnsserver - sets up geo database and uses a socket to listen to incoming requests
    - listens for DNS queries from clients
    - checks if dns query domain is allowed customer "name"
    	> responds with nxdomain if query domain is not customer "name"
    - gets all replica server ips
    - gets all replica server locations via binary search of geo cache
    - determines client location
    - Determines closest replica server to client and sends dns packet with replica server ip
    	in response

ISSUES:
- Port address in use sometimes - hard to test as the socket creation fails

WHO DID WHAT:
Utkarshna - deploy/run/stop scripts, httpserver
Ramzi - built dns server, implemented geo cache strategy, tested/verified geo functions,
		built client.py file for testing dnsserver
