#QUESTIONS
1. How does the http server behave with the replica servers?
- does it get run on each server (20MB/server); 
- is it a good idea to preload this with top 20MB expected given Zipf (continue with LRU after that)
- can we zip/unzip files on the server (zipfile library)
- do we use the requests library to access the origin

2. Is it possible for a machine to generate a remote ping from client->server
